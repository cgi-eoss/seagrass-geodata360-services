title: scikit-learn training sample extraction
identifier:
  identifier: sklearn-extract-training-samples
  version: 1.0.0
abstract: |-
  Given a raster product and corresponding pixel mask, plus ground truth
  vector data, extract to a 1D array the valid samples, i.e. those pixels from
  the product which are not masked and intersect with the ground truth data.

  The output consists of two arrays in a single numpy compressed .npz file:
  `samples` with shape (N, M) (where M is the number of features/bands in the
  source product) and correlated `ground_truth` with shape (N,).
  
  The output arrays are suitable for use in scikit-learn `.fit()` methods as
  the `X` and `y` parameters respectively.
