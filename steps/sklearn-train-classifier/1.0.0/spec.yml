title: scikit-learn classifier training
identifier:
  identifier: sklearn-train-classifier
  version: 1.0.0
abstract: |-
  Given preselected and reshaped training data samples, fit a classifier model
  and serialise it for later use.
  
  The input format is expected to be one or more numpy compressed .npz files,
  each containing aligned `samples` and `ground_truth`. These are loaded and
  concatenated before being used to train a classifier with the `fit` method.
  
  The output is the trained classifier, serialised by `joblib.dump`, for later
  loading by `joblib.load`, which can subsequently be used to generate
  predictions on new input data. An auxiliary file contains the parameters used
  to generate the model.

    Numpy compressed .npz files containing `samples` and `ground_truth` arrays
    for training a model.

- identifier: AUX_FILE
  title: Model description auxiliary file

    An auxiliary file to track the inputs and parameters used in generation of 
    the model.

parameters:

- identifier: GRID_SEARCH_CROSS_VALIDATION
  title: Toggle dynamic parameter evaluation for training
  abstract: |-
    If true, perform a grid-search cross-validation with a (hardcoded) set of
    preselected default parameters for the classifier. The best estimator will
    be used as the output MODEL.
    
    Default: true
  data_type: BOOLEAN
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: TRAINING_FEATURES
  title: Features (bands) to be used in the training
  abstract: |-
    Space-separated list of band numbers (0-indexed) to be used when training 
    the classifier. This set should reference some or all bands available in
    the `samples` arrays.
    
    Default: Sentinel-2 sensing bands, plus seagrass habitat suitability model
  data_type: STRING
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: SKLEARN_CLASSIFIER
  title: scikit-learn classifier name
  abstract: |-
    Classifier class from scikit-learn to be trained on the input data.
    Specific parameter mapping is required, so a limited selection is allowed.
    
    Default: RandomForestClassifier
  data_type: STRING
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1
  allowed_values:
  - { type: VALUE, value: '' }
  - { type: VALUE, value: 'RandomForestClassifier' }
