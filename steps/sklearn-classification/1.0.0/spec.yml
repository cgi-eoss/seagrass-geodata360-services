  version: 1.0.0
abstract: |-
  Given a trained scikit-learn classifier, process a source product to create
  a classification map.
  
  An optional secondary output is a corresponding class probability map
  containing the classifier's probability estimates for each pixel.

inputs:
- identifier: CLASSIFIER
  title: Serialised sklearn classifier
  abstract: |-
    A `joblib.dump`-serialised classifier object, trained on something relevant
    for PRODUCT.
  min_occurs: 1
  max_occurs: 1
  format: BINARY

- identifier: PRODUCT
  title: Source raster product
  abstract: |-
    Input product from which training samples should be extracted.
  min_occurs: 1
  max_occurs: 1
  format: RASTER

- identifier: MASK
  title: Source product mask
  abstract: |-
    Mask for the input product, describing which pixels should be considered
    valid (value `1`) or invalid (value `0`).
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1
  format: RASTER

outputs:

- identifier: CLASSIFIED
  title: Classification map
  abstract: |-
    Single band TIFF classified into values corresponding to classes used in
    model training.
  min_occurs: 1
  max_occurs: 1
  format: GEOTIFF

- identifier: CLASS_PROBABILITY
  title: Classification probability map
  abstract: |-
    Multi-band TIFF where bands correspond to the classes in the original
    vector training data, with values set to the classifier probability.
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1
  format: GEOTIFF

parameters:

- identifier: TRAINING_FEATURES
  title: Features (bands) to be used in the training
  abstract: |-
    Space-separated list of band numbers (0-indexed) used in training the
    classifier. This set should reference some or all bands available in
    the PRODUCT, and correspond with the value used in the sklearn-train-classifier step
    
    Default: Sentinel-2 sensing bands, plus seagrass habitat suitability model

  title: Create class probability product
  abstract: |-
    If true, additionally calculate and emit a class probability product.
