parameters:

- identifier: TRAINING_SHAPEFILE_ATTR
  title: Shapefile attribute containing training class identifier
  abstract: |-
    The attribute in the training data shapefile containing the classes to be
    detected and matched in the `INPUT` images.
  data_type: STRING
  min_occurs: 1
  max_occurs: 1
  default_values: ["MC_ID"]

- identifier: TRAINING_FEATURES
  title: Features (bands) to be used in the training
  abstract: |-
    Space-separated list of band numbers (0-indexed) to be used when training 
    the classifier. This set should reference some or all bands available in
    the `INPUT` images and must have the same number of elements as the entries
    in the `STATISTICS` XML file (if provided).
    
    Default: All bands of the s2-seagrass-normalisation:4.0.0 step.
  data_type: STRING
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: MAX_DEPTH
  title: Maximum depth of the tree
  abstract: |-
    The depth of the tree. A low value will likely underfit and conversely
    a high value will likely overfit. The optimal value can be obtained
    using cross validation or other suitable methods.
    
    Default: 5
  data_type: INTEGER
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: MIN_SAMPLES
  title: Minimum number of samples in each node
  abstract: |-
    If the number of samples in a node is smaller than this parameter, then
    the node will not be split. A reasonable value is a small percentage of
    the total data e.g. 1 percent.
    
    Default: 10
  data_type: INTEGER
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: REGRESSION_ACCURACY
  title: Termination criteria for regression tree
  abstract: |-
    If all absolute differences between an estimated value in a node and the
    values of the train samples in this node are smaller than this regression
    accuracy parameter, then the node will not be split.
    
    Default: 0
  data_type: FLOAT
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: CATEGORICAL_CLUSTERS
  title: Categorical clusters
  abstract: |-
    Cluster possible values of a categorical variable into K <= cat clusters to
    find a suboptimal split.
    
    Default: 10
  data_type: INTEGER
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: SUBSET_SIZE
  title: Size of the randomly selected subset of features at each tree node
  abstract: |-
    The size of the subset of features, randomly selected at each tree node,
    that are used to find the best split(s). If you set it to 0, then the
    size will be set to the square root of the total number of features.
    
    Default: 0
  data_type: INTEGER
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: MAX_TREES
  title: Maximum number of trees in the forest
  abstract: |-
    The maximum number of trees in the forest. Typically, the more trees you
    have, the better the accuracy. However, the improvement in accuracy
    generally diminishes and reaches an asymptote for a certain number of
    trees. Also to keep in mind, increasing the number of trees increases
    the prediction time linearly.
    
    Default: 100
  data_type: INTEGER
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: SUFFICIENT_ACCURACY
  title: Sufficient accuracy (OOB error)
  abstract: |-
    Sufficient accuracy (OOB error).
    
    Default: 0.01
  data_type: FLOAT
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: RANDOM_SEED
  title: Random seed
  abstract: |-
    A seed for random number generation. Used in the OTB applications
    SampleSelection and TrainVectorClassifier. If set, the same seed is used in
    both applications. If not set, each seed is chosen randomly.
  data_type: INTEGER
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1
