title: Compute band statistics across a stack of images
version: 1.1.0
abstract: |-
  Takes one or more GeoTIFF images, and computes the per-band mean, min, max,
  and standard deviation.
  
  Output is in XML format, equivalent to the OTB ComputeImageStatistics
  application.
  
  This implementation deals better with larger stacks, but also allows
  horizontal scalability by emitting an additional "samples" attribute when
  given a single input file, allowing the merge-images-statistics Step to merge
  the outputs of multiple instances of this Step.

outputs:
  - identifier: IMAGES_STATISTICS
    title: Per-band statistics of the input images
    abstract: |-
      XML file containing feature statistics for each band: mean, min,
      max and standard deviation.

  - identifier: MASK_BAND
    title: Image bandname containing 0 values to indicate nodata
    abstract: |-
      A band name from the INPUT images in which 0 values indicate nodata for
      all bands in the image, i.e. a mask.
      
      Default: SCL
    data_type: String

  - identifier: BAND_NUMBERS
    title: Bands for which to emit statistics
    abstract: |-
      Space-separated list of band numbers (0-indexed) for which statistics
      should be computed. This set should reference some or all bands available
      in the `INPUT` images.
        
      Default: All bands of the s2-seagrass-normalisation:3.0.0 step.
