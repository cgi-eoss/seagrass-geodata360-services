title: Satellite data normalisation for seagrass processing
version: 4.0.3
abstract: |-
  Merges the input data for seagrass processing in a predictable way, i.e. with
  deterministic GeoTIFF band order.
  
  Inputs:
  - Sentinel-2 L2A GeoTIFF
  - Habitat Suitability Model GeoTIFF
  
  Output is in Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFF format at 10m resolution.

parameters:

- identifier: MASK_EXPRESSION
  title: Masking bandmaths expression
  abstract: |-
    Custom bandmaths to be applied to the output product to generate a mask
    product. This argument is provided to gdal_calc.py, and bands are selected
    A..Z based on their index in the product.
    
    For example, to use the SCL band (`O`) to select only water pixels and the
    CLD band (`N`) with a threshold:
    ```
    (O==6) & (N<5)
    ```
  min_occurs: 1
  max_occurs: 1
  data_type: String

- identifier: COMPRESS
  title: GeoTIFF compression
  abstract: |-
    The desired compression for the data in the GeoTIFF product. See
    https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/cog.html for the available options.
    
    Default: DEFLATE
  data_type: String
  min_occurs: 0
  max_occurs: 1

- identifier: UNSCALE
  title: Unscale output
  abstract: |-
    If true, the output GeoTIFF will be 'unscaled' - any configured data offset
    or scale will be applied to the data values directly in the output.
    Negative values will be clipped to 0.
    
    Default: true
  data_type: Boolean
  min_occurs: 0
