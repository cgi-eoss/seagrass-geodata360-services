title: Combine all bands of an S-2 Level 2A product into a GeoTIFF file
version: 1.2.0
abstract: |-
  Takes an MSIL2A image produced by Sen2Cor, and creates a Cloud-Optimised
  GeoTIFF (BigTIFF) containing all bands up-sampled to 10m resolution.

- identifier: S2_GEOTIFF
  title: Full Sentinel-2 product in GeoTIFF format
  abstract: |-
    All bands of the input product, with 10m resolution, in Cloud-Optimised
    GeoTIFF format.
    
    In the case of multi-granule S-2 products, a separate GeoTIFF is created
    for each UTM zone.

parameters:

- identifier: COMPRESS
  title: GeoTIFF compression
  abstract: |-
    The desired compression for the data in the GeoTIFF product. See
    https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/cog.html for the available options.
    
    Default: DEFLATE

- identifier: APPLY_OFFSET
  title: Apply data offset
  abstract: |-
    If true, apply the radiometric data offset defined in the MTD_MSIL2A.xml
    file to data bands. The offset is applied as a factor directly on the band.
    
    If false, the offset value is not applied, and actual data values will need
    correction before valid processing.
    
    In both cases, the offset value is also tracked as a metadata field
    `BOA_ADD_OFFSET` on each band.
