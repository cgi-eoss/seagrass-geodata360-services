# S-2 L2A GeoTIFF conversion step

Combine all bands of an S-2 Level 2A product into a GeoTIFF file with 10m
pixels.

## Inputs

- `INPUT`: A Sentinel-2 Level 2A dataset (tile product) in SAFE format, e.g.
  generated by Sen2Cor. May be zipped.

## Outputs

- `S2_GEOTIFF`: Full Sentinel-2 product in Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFF format.

## Parameters

- `COMPRESS`: (OPTIONAL) The desired compression for the data in the GeoTIFF
  product. See https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/cog.html for the available
  options.
  
  Default: DEFLATE

- `APPLY_OFFSET`: (OPTIONAL) Whether to apply radiometric data offset in the
  GeoTIFF.

  If true, apply the radiometric data offset defined in the MTD_MSIL2A.xml
  file to data bands. The offset is applied as a factor directly on the band.

  If false, the offset value is not applied, and actual data values will need
  correction before valid processing.

  In both cases, the offset value is also tracked as a metadata field
  `BOA_ADD_OFFSET` on each band.

  See the '04.00' processing baseline description on
  https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/processing-baseline
  for further details.

  Default: true`
