version: 2.0.1
abstract: |-
  Merges single band Classification layer and single band Confidence layer to remove all but target class and pixels
  below the defined confidence threshold are masked out.
  
  Inputs:
  - Classified GeoTIFF
  - Confidence GeoTIFF
  
  Output is in GeoTIFF format at 10m resolution.

outputs:
- identifier: SINGLE_CLASS_CONFIDENCE
  abstract: |-
    Single band TIFF displaying confidence of a single class defined by CLASS_ID. Low

parameters:

- identifier: CONF_MASK_THRESHOLD
  title: Confidence Masking Threshold
  abstract: |-
    Value between 0 and 1 defining threshold classification confidence (proportion of votes for the majority class)
    for a given pixel below which will be filtered out from the classification image.

    Default: 0.1
    ```
  min_occurs: 1
  max_occurs: 1
  data_type: Float
  default_value: [ 0.1 ]

- identifier: CLASS_ID
  title: Class Identifier
  abstract: |-
    Integer value identifying the desired class to be displayed in the confidence map. Value should match one of those 
    defined by the input model.

    Default: 1

  max_occurs: 1
  data_type: Integer
  default_value: [ 1 ]
